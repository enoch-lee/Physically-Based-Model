The demo is built in three.js. 

1.[Dancing Ball](bounce-ball.html)

The first demo used simple physical model to display balls bouncing in a box. A simple collision algorithm is implemented to handle with multi-balls interaction. Though it is not a perfect solution, it looks smooth and natural. Try to explore it and have fun!

2.[Particle System](particel.html)

A vocalno will erupt with the frequency of music. A spinning icosahedron is put in the scene to test the algorithm of particle collision detection. Try different music and enjoy!
